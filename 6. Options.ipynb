The seller, or option writer, is obligated to fulfill the terms of the contract if the buyer chooses to exercise their option. Options can be used for a variety of purposes, such as hedging risk or speculating on the price movement of an asset. There are two main types of options: **call** options, which give the buyer the right to buy the underlying asset, and **put** options, which give the buyer the right to sell the underlying asset. For both types of options, one can either **long** them (buy) or **short** them (sell). There are different types of options with different obligations. For now, we will focus on the **European** ones, which can only be executed at the expiration date.\n","\n","Naturally, the fact that the owner of an option has a right but no obligation means that options have an intrinsic value, as the owner of an option has more freedom than the seller. This means that, as opposed to say, forward contracts, options have a non-zero price (you must *pay* to gain the favourable contractual situation). A major field of finance concerns the valuation of options, that is, to find how the price of the option, $C(t=0)$, is set, and how it changes over time.\n","\n","\n","As we said, a European call long option gives the owner the right, but not the obligation, to buy the underlying at maturity $T$ and at the strike prince $K$. A rational owner of the option will only exercise it if the price of the underlying, $S(t)$, is larger than the strike price $K$ (otherwise, it is more profitable to throw away the option and directly buy the asset from the market). Thus, there are two regimes: if $S(t)> K$ (*in the money*), the owner can buy the option and sell the asset in the market, making a profit $\\pi=S(t)-K-C_0$ (note that we must discount the price of the option, $C_0$, from the payoff). If $S(t)< K$ , the option is worthless, so $\\pi(t)=-C_0$ (*out of the money*). This means that options, as opposed to other financial instruments, have a **nonlinear payoff**, which for call long options is:\n","\n","$$\\pi(Y,T) = \\max(S(T) - K - C_0, -C_0)$$\n","\n","The fact that options show non-linear payoffs is the key reason why their pricing is significantly harder than other assets such as stocks and forwards.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"ohvl4bLqn6iv"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# Exercise 1:\n","1.

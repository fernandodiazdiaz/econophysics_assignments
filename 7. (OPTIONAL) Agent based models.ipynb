From the repeated interactions of these agents, complex phenomena emerge without being hard-coded. This makes them a powerful modelling tool to understand complex systems. ABMs have been applied to ecology, traffic flow, social networks…and finance.  In financial ABMs, each agent might represent an investor whose buy/sell decisions depend on others’ opinions, news, risk preferences, etc.  \n","\n","\n","\n","The key advantages of ABM are:  \n","- **Flexibility**: rules can be tailored with remarkable ease, without having to create code from scratch.\n","- **Nonlinearity**: complex nonlinear behaviors usually correspond to simple transition rules. THus, it is simpler to code ABM than to solve the corresponding nonlinear dynamical equations.\n","- **Emergence**: simple rules often lead to complex emergent phenomena.\n","\n","\n","# The Corcos Model\n","\n","**Reference:**  \n","A Corcos, J-P Eckmann, A Malaspinas, Y Malevergne & D Sornette (2002).  \n","_“Imitation and contrarian behaviour: hyperbolic bubbles, crashes and chaos”_, Quantitative Finance 2 (4), 264–281.\n","\n","\n","Here, we will replicate the results of a particularly simple ABM that leads to bubbles and crashes. In the model, every agent holds one of two possible opinions about tomorrow’s price: bullish or bearish.  A bullish agent, represented by the state $+1$, expects prices to rise, whereas a bearish agent, represented by the state $-1$, expects prices to fall.\n","\n","At each discrete time step, every agent forms a new opinion by consulting a small, randomly chosen group of peers.  Specifically, each agent samples exactly $m$ other agents from the population, with a fresh random draw at every step, and then decides whether to keep her current stance or to switch.  This random polling captures the idea that real investors rarely have complete information and instead rely on the views of a handful of contacts.\n","\n","The decision to switch opinion is driven by two complementary tendencies.  The first tendency is imitation of the opposite opinion.  A bullish agent will switch to bearish if she finds that at least a fraction $\\rho_{hb}$ of her sampled peers are bearish.  This rule models a herding impulse: “if so many of my contacts are selling, perhaps I should sell too.”  In exactly the same way, a bearish agent will switch to bullish if at least a fraction $\\rho_{bh}$ of her sampled peers are bullish.\n","\n","The second tendency is contrarian reversal of one’s own opinion.  A bullish agent who observes at least a fraction $\\rho_{hh}$ of her sampled peers also bullish will switch to bearish out of concern that the rally has become overextended and must reverse.  Similarly, a bearish agent who finds at least a fraction $\\rho_{bb}$ of her sampled peers also bearish will flip to bullish, believing that the sell-off has gone too far and prices must revert.\n","\n","\n","Our main order parameter will be the fraction of bullish agents, which we denote by $p(t)$. In addition, we will also be interested in studying how returns get affected by the herding and contrarian behavior. We will simply take the returns to be proportional to the fraction of bullish agents (if more than half of the agents are bulish, the returns go up due to speculative behavior):\n","\n","$r(t) = \\gamma\\,\\bigl(p(t) - \\tfrac12\\bigr)$,\n","\n","so that positive values correspond to net buying pressure and negative values to net selling pressure. The price time series $\\pi(t)$ then evolves according to  \n","\n","$\\pi(t+1)=\\pi(t)e^{r(t+1)}$\n","\n","Here you can find a summary of the four main transition rules of the ABM:\n","\n","  | Current state | Flip if sample fraction ≥ | Behavior     |\n","  |:-------------:|:--------------------------:|:-------------|\n","  | Bullish → Bearish | $ρ_{hb}$  of bearish       | Imitate the crowd  \n","  | Bullish → Bearish | $ρ_{hh}$  of bullish       | Contrarian “too hot”  \n","  | Bearish → Bullish | $ρ_{bh}$  of bullish       | Imitate the crowd  \n","  | Bearish → Bullish | $ρ_{bh}$  of bearish       | Contrarian “too cold”  \n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"LjfPsIAQA9gC"},"source":["## Exercise 1  \n","Write a program to implement the described ABM.
